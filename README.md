# Hi there, I'm Zafar Avzalshoev 👋  

I am a **Research Fellow** at the *Institute of Engineering Innovation, The University of Tokyo (Japan)*.  
My research explores the **integration of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)** into **civil, geotechnical, and environmental engineering** — bridging physical experiments, numerical simulations, and data-driven modeling for natural hazard prediction and monitoring.  

I’m also working on my own initiative, **TajGEM (Tajikistan Glacier Evolution Model)**, to build an open AI-powered monitoring system for **glacier evolution and natural hazard assessment across Central Asia**.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- 🏔️ **[TajGEM (Tajikistan Glacier Evolution Model)](https://github.com/Rumi27/TajGEM)** — Central Asia glacier evolution model integrating ERA5 climate data, RGI inventories, and ensemble ML/deep learning models.  
- 🌋 **Landslide Ensemble Project** — Modeling landslide using ensemble ML and SHAP interpretability.  
- 💧 **Hydro-Climate AI** — Hybrid AI–physics modeling of glacier–hydrology systems.  
- 🧠 **LLM Framework** — Multi-agent LLM system.  

---

### 🌱 Exploring:
- Integration of **AI/LLMs** with laboratory and numerical models for landslide, liquefaction, and glacier evolution processes.  
- **Physics-informed and symbolic AI** discovering governing equations of geotechnical systems.  
- Development of **multi-agent AI ecosystems** for slope stability and regional hazard monitoring in Central Asia.  
- Fusion of **remote sensing, DEM analysis, and ML** for real-time geohazard detection.
